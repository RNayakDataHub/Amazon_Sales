Size Distribution:

L-size: 5,875 units

XL-size: 5,543 units

XXL-size: 4,518 units

Least Popular Sizes: 4XL, 5XL and 6XL had significantly lower sales

2. Category Performance

18.3% were in transit ("Shipped")

5.1% were cancelled ("Cancelled")

4. Geographic Insights
Top States:

Maharashtra (16.6% of total orders)

5. Business Metrics
Average Order Value: ₹646.55

Median Order Value: ₹629.00

Conclusions
Size Strategy: The strong preference for M, L, and XL sizes suggests inventory should be weighted toward these sizes, with limited stock of larger sizes (4XL+).

Category Focus: T-shirts represent the most significant opportunity for growth and inventory investment given their popularity.

Regional Marketing: Maharashtra and Karnataka should be priority markets for targeted marketing campaigns and promotions.

Order Fulfillment: With nearly 1 in 20 orders being cancelled, there may be opportunities to improve the ordering process or product descriptions.

Pricing Strategy: The median order value (₹629) could serve as a benchmark for promotional pricing strategies.

Business Model: The dominance of retail over B2B (99.3% vs 0.7%) suggests potential to develop the B2B channel.

Recommendations
